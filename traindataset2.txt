The key innovation of transformer models is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence based on their contextual relationships. Unlike previous models, which processed input data sequentially, transformers can process all words in a sentence simultaneously, making them highly parallelizable and efficient.

Transformers consist of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks. Each layer of the transformer performs the following operations:

Self-Attention: The self-attention mechanism computes attention scores for each word in the input sequence, indicating how much focus should be given to each word when encoding the sentence. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and semantic relationships between words.

Feedforward Neural Network: After computing attention scores, the transformer applies a feedforward neural network to each word's representation independently. This network consists of fully connected layers with activation functions, allowing the model to learn complex non-linear relationships in the data.

Residual Connections and Layer Normalization: To facilitate training and improve performance, transformers use residual connections and layer normalization between each layer. Residual connections allow gradients to flow more easily during training, while layer normalization helps stabilize the training process by normalizing the activations within each layer.

Positional Encoding: Since transformers process input data in parallel, they do not inherently capture the sequential order of words in a sentence. To address this limitation, transformers incorporate positional encoding vectors into their input representations, which encode the relative positions of words in the input sequence.

Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks, including language translation, text generation, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering. Notable transformer-based models include:

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): Introduced by Google, BERT is a pre-trained transformer model that learns contextual representations of words bidirectionally, capturing both left and right context.
